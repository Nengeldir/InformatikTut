# InformatikTut
## General Information
Used to teach ComputerScience in C++. One can find the solution and skeleton code for each task, such that it is possible to solve the tasks alone. The code should be reasonably documented.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Hello World

### Exercise 2: Read and Output Data

### Exercise 3: Types

### Exercise 4: Control Flow

### Exercise 5: Calculate Pi
We can use the following formula for an approximate version

$$ 4 \cdot \sum^\infty_{k = 0} \frac{(-1)^k}{2k + 1} \approx \Pi $$

where we truncate the sum by only consider summands for $0 \leq k \leq n$.


### Exercise 6:
